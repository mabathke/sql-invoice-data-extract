# sql-invoice-data-extract
This script is designed to extract necessary data required for creating a dashboard for a family member's company. The script's primary objective is twofold:
a) to gather information from a vast number of tables, and
b) identify the tables that are relevant for the dashboarding purpose.

The outcome of the script is a new table that holds valuable information about invoices and SELECT-Statements that highlight other pertinent tables. 
As the tables contain sensitive data, I will only share the script and not the actual data.
